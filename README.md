# MeshworkTutorial
An introduction notebook for Meshwork objects

Note that this requires a copy of [MeshParty](https://github.com/sdorkenw/MeshParty) version 3 or higher.
The MeshWork interface is under active development, and the line between clumsy interface and bug is a fuzzy one.

Get in touch if you have questions/suggestions, or use the github issues page over on MeshParty.
